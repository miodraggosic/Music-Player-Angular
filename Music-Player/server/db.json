      "description": "Super Fly is the third studio album by American soul musician Curtis Mayfield, released in July 1972 on Curtom Records. It was released as the soundtrack for the Blaxploitation film of the same name. Widely considered a classic of 1970s soul and funk music, Super Fly was a nearly immediate hit. Its sales were bolstered by two million-selling singles, \\\"Freddie's Dead\\\" and the title track. Super Fly is one of the few soundtracks to out-gross the film it accompanied.",

On a bright autumn morning, the legends arrived at the NPR Music office bleary-eyed yet excited to play for the diverse staff of Shaggy and Sting fans. What surprised many of my NPR colleagues is just how well the collaboration works.",

Seeing him years ago was the whole reason I decided to try improvisational performance in the first place...getting to chill and make up some bullshit with him was quite literally a dream come true!! So grateful to him for letting me into his space; we made music for hours and had a wonderful time. I think it’s safe to say there’s more on the horizon. Stay tuned ",

      "description": "Darkwood Dub was an art rock/electro rock band from Belgrade, Serbia.\nDarkwood Dub was formed in 1988, and gradually grew to prominence, and even cult status, in the Serbian alternative scene. Their music is characterized by gentle bass lines, a mixture of live drumming and electronic percussion, along with frequent use of slide guitar, synthesizers and samplers. The succinct and introspective lyrics are also a prominent feature, sung with offbeat vocal of Dejan Vučetić, the band's frontman and lyricist.",
