      "description": "Super Fly is the third studio album by American soul musician Curtis Mayfield, released in July 1972 on Curtom Records. It was released as the soundtrack for the Blaxploitation film of the same name. Widely considered a classic of 1970s soul and funk music, Super Fly was a nearly immediate hit. Its sales were bolstered by two million-selling singles, \\\"Freddie's Dead\\\" and the title track. Super Fly is one of the few soundtracks to out-gross the film it accompanied.",
